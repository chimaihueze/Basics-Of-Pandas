# Maps allow us to transform data in a DataFrame or Series one value at a time for an entire column.
# However, often we want to group our data, and then do something specific to the group the data is in.
# As you'll learn, we do this with the groupby() operation.
# We'll also cover some additional topics, such as more complex ways to index your DataFrames, along with how to sort your data.

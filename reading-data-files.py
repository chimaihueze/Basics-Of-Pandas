# Being able to create a DataFrame or Series by hand is handy.
# But, most of the time, we won't actually be creating our own data by hand.
# Instead, we'll be working with data that already exists.

# Data can be stored in any of a number of different forms and formats. 
# By far the most basic of these is the humble CSV file.

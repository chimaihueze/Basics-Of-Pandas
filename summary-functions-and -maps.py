# Plucking the right data out of our data representation is critical to getting work done.
# However, the data does not always come out of memory in the format we want it in right out of the bat.
# Sometimes we have to do some more work ourselves to reformat it for the task at hand.
# This tutorial will cover different operations we can apply to our data to get the input "just right".

import pandas as pd

abc = pd.reas_csv('pandas_data.csv')

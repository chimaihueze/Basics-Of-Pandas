# Pandas is a Python library used for working with data sets.
# It has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data.
# Pandas allows us to analyze big data and make conclusions based on statistical theories.
# Pandas can clean messy data sets, and make them readable and relevant.
# Relevant data is very important in data science.
# Pandas are also able to delete rows that are not relevant, or contains wrong values, like empty or NULL values. This is called cleaning the data.
# In pandas, a data table is called a DataFrame.

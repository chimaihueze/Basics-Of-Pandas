# Empty cells can potentially give you a wrong result when you analyze data.

# Remove Rows
# One way to deal with empty cells is to remove rows that contain empty cells.
# This is usually OK, since data sets can be very big, and removing a few rows will not have a big impact on the result.

# Example
# Return a new Data Frame with no empty cells:

import pandas as pd
